# bmfont2cs
http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ spec to C#

Bitmap fonts "specification" from angelcode.com specifies a bitmap and xml file for a font.
This code will generate C# code from these files.
See project SupraBitKid/chicago for the PerportionalFontBase class.

Future work:
 output an entire project instead of just a .cs file
 Options for the orientation of the bytes in the monochrome bitmap data (currently vertical)
